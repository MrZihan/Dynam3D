The code in this folder is designed to convert VLN datasets from discrete environments into the continuous Habitat simulator. 
Due to an unresolved bug, the Habitat simulator is unable to load additional scenes after a certain number have been processed, which causes the conversion process to terminate. Therefore, for large-scale datasets such as ScaleVLN and NavRAG, the Python script must be run multiple times to perform the conversion in batches. Intermediate results are saved in temporary JSON files.
